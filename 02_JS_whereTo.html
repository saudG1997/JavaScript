        JavaScript Where To
        The <script> Tag
        In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

        // JavaScript Functions and Events
        A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.
        For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
    -->

    <!--
        JavaScript in <head> or <body>
        You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
        Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
    -->

    <!--
        JavaScript in <head>
        In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
        The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:
    -->
    <h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>
    <p id="demo2">A Paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction1()">Try it</button>

    <!--
        JavaScript in <body>
        In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <body> section of an HTML page.
        The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:
    -->
    <h2>Demo JavaScript in Body</h2>
    <p id="demo3">A Paragraph</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFunction2()">Try it</button>
    <script>
    function myFunction2() {
    document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
    }
    </script>

    <!-- External JavaScript -->
    <!-- Scripts can also be placed in external files: -->
    <!-- External file: myScript.js -->
    <!-- 
        function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
            }
    -->
    <!--
        External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
        JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
        To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
        <script src="myScript.js"></script>
    -->
   
    <!--
        You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
        The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.
    -->
    <!--
        Notes:
        External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
    -->

    <!-- External JavaScript Advantages -->
    <!--
        Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

            - It separates HTML and code
            - It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
            - Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
        To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:
        Example:
            <script src="myScript1.js"></script>
            <script src="myScript2.js"></script>
    -->

    <!-- External References -->
    <!--
        An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

        - With a full URL (a full web address)
        - With a file path (like /js/)
        - Without any path
    -->
    <!--
        This example uses a full URL to link to myScript.js:
        <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>
    -->
        
    <!--
        This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js:
        <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
    -->
        
    <!--
        This example uses no path to link to myScript.js:
        <script src="myScript.js"></script> 
    -->
         
</body>
</html>
