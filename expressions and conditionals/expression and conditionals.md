# Expressions & Conditionals
A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value written literally is an expression. for example: 77 or "apple"

## Operators in JavaScript
** Arithmetic Operators
    +   *    Addition
    -       Subtraction
    *       Multiplication
    **      Exponentiation
    /       Division
    %       Modulus
    ++      Increment
    --      Decrement


** assignment Operators
    =       x = y
    +=      x = x + y
    -=      x = x - y
    *=      x = x * y
    /=      x = x / y
    %=      x = x % y
    **=     x = x ** y

** Comparison Operators
    ==      equal to
    !=      not equal
    ===     equal value and types
    !==     not equal value or not equal type
    >       greater than
    <       less than
    >=      greater than or equal to
    <=      less than or equal to
    ?       turnary Operator

** Logical Operators
    &&      Logical AND
    ||      Logical OR
    !       Logical NOT

Apart from these, we also have type and bitwise operators. Bitwise operators perform bit by bit operations on numbers
example:
        7 + 8 = 15
        where,
            7 and 8 are Operands
            + are assignment Operator and
            15 are the Result
